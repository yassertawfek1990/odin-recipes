    <p>If you’re Italian and you’re thinking, cottage cheese in lasagna? I totally get you! I always turned my nose up to that idea. But with great cottage cheese brands available these days, I recently made these Lasagna Roll Ups with Cottage Cheese and my family went nuts over it! So, I set out to create a cottage-cheese version of my go-to Italian lasagna with meat sauce, and I’ll never make it any other way. It doesn’t change the flavor or texture of the final dish, it just adds more protein – my family devoured it! So if you’re reading this and thinking, “Cottage cheese in lasagna?” I swear it works. You can’t tell at all! More lasagna recipes you may love are this Lasagna Soup Recipe, Spaghetti Squash Sausage Lasagna Boats, and Chicken Parmesan Lasagna.</p>
    <p>This homemade lasagna recipe pairs well with some French bread, garlic bread or garlic knots and an Italian salad or veggies, like Roasted Broccoli and Cauliflower or Cacio e Pepe Brussels Sprouts.</p>

    <header><h3>Steps</h3></header>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Tomato Sauce: Add the ground beef, onion, and garlic to a large skillet or large pot and cook on medium-high until the meat is no longer pink. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes, stir a few times.</li>
        <li>Make the Cheese Mixture: Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl and add the cottage cheese, a half cup of mozzarella, Pecorino Romano, and parsley.</li>
        <li>How to Layer Lasagna: Spread a cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 13-x-9- inch casserole dish, followed by four lasagna noodles, a third of the cheese mixture, and a cup of sauce, and repeat. Next, pour the remaining sauce on top and sprinkle with the rest of the mozzarella.</li>
        <li>How Long to Bake Lasagna: Cooking time is about 1 hour. Cover the baking dish tight with aluminum foil to create steam to cook the noodles, and bake for 55 to 60 minutes until the pasta is cooked through. Uncover and cook for another five minutes until all the cheese browns slightly.</li>
        <li>Serve: Garnish the lasagna with parsley and let sit for five minutes before cutting into eight pieces.</li>
